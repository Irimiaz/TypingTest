# TypingTest

This is a Python Project which tests the user's typing speed by counting the number of correct words written in a limited amount of time. It currently has 3 available windows (Main, Settings and Play).

In the Main window, the user can choose to close the application or navigate to the other windows. In addition, on every window there is a back button on the top left which takes the user to the previous window.

In the Settings window, the user can set the time limit as well as choose the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). The difficulty is set by the length of the words generated by the application.

In the Play window, the user can start typing the words shown on the screen as fast as possible. As the time runs out, on the bottom of the window it will be shown the number of correct, incorrect words, the score and the CPS (Characters Per Seconds). A notification will appear on the screen that will tell that there is no more time left and the users will have the opportunity to start over again or close the application.

The game can be started by typing the following command: ./python3 main.py
